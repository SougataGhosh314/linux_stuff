Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.

Sleep is good, he said. And books are better.

It is one thing to be clever and another to be wise.

A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.

Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and
I'll sleep more easily by night.

vi filename
    Command Mode: 
When vi starts up, it is in Command Mode. This mode is where vi interprets any characters we type as commands and thus does not display them in the window. This mode allows us to move through a file, and to delete, copy, or paste a piece of text.
To enter into Command Mode from any other mode, it requires pressing the [Esc] key. If we press [Esc] when we are already in Command Mode, then vi will beep or flash the screen.


    Insert mode: This mode enables you to insert text into the file. Everything that’s typed in this mode is interpreted as input and finally, it is put in the file. The vi always starts in command mode. To enter text, you must be in insert mode. To come in insert mode you simply type i. To get out of insert mode, press the Esc key, which will put you back into command mode.


    Last Line Mode(Escape Mode): Line Mode is invoked by typing a colon [:], while vi is in Command Mode. The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for a command. This mode enables you to perform tasks such as saving files, executing commands.

Sample output:

1) Create .tar archive file

To create an uncompressed tar (.tar) , use -c option with tar command as following:
$ tar -cvf /path/to/foo.tar /path/to/foo/

Where '/path/to/foo.tar' is the location of resulting tar file, and '/path/to/foo' is the location of the file or directory to use as input.


2) Extract .tar archive file
To extract an uncompressed archive which often has an extension .tar, the command syntax is:
$ tar -xvf /path/to/foo.tar
Where /path/to/foo.tar is the absolute/relative path to the location of a tar file.

Sample output:

[sougata@localhost archives]$ tree
.
└── toCompress
    ├── another.txt
    ├── new.txt
    └── numbers.txt

# Transferring Files with NFS
To configure the server, proceed as follows:
1.	Prepare the system:
a.	Open a shell, log in as root and grant write permissions to all users:
b.	mkdir /srv/nfs
c.	chgrp users /srv/nfs
chmod g+w /srv/nfs


Make sure users of the same name exist on client and server. Refer to Chapter 5, Managing Users with YaST for a detailed instruction on how to create and manage user accounts.
2.	Prepare the NFS server:
a.	Start YaST as root.
b.	Select Network Services+NFS Server.
c.	Enable NFS services with Start.
d.	Open the appropriate firewall port with Open Port in Firewall, if you are using a firewall.
3.	Export the directories:
a.	Click Add directory and select /srv/nfs.
b.	Set the export options to:
rw,root_squash,async
c.	Repeat these steps, if you need to export more than one directory.
4.	Apply your settings and leave YaST. Your NFS server is ready to use.
To start the NFS server, enter the following command (as root):
rcnfsserver start
To stop the server, enter:
rcnfsserver stop
To configure the client, proceed as follows:
1.	Prepare the NFS client:
a.	Start YaST as root.
b.	Select Network Services+NFS Client.
c.	Activate Open Port in Firewall, if using a firewall.
2.	Import the remote file system:
a.	Click Add.
b.	Enter the name or IP address of the NFS server or click choose to automatically scan the network for NFS servers.
c.	Enter the name of your remote file system or automatically choose it with Select.
d.	Enter an appropriate mount point, for example /mnt.
e.	Repeat these steps, if you need to import more than one external directory.
3.	Apply your settings and leave YaST. Your NFS client is ready to use.
To manually start the NFS client, enter:
rcnfs start



some more useful commands:
(note: use yum instead of apt for fedora or cent OS)
	

	apt install default-jre
	 
	apt install default-jdk
	

	apt install maven
	

	apt install git
(env variables will be auto configured this way and you won’t require to do any configuration for maven and git and jdk while installing Jenkins, just install suggested plugins and you’re good to go)
	

	ufw allow 8080
	

	ufw allow OpenSSH
	

	ufw status
	

	ufw enable
(above commands used to make sure Jenkins is not blocked by firewall)
	

	java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=<portno>
	

	fuser -k 8080/tcp
(to kill process already listening to port 8080)


(remarks: commands may vary slightly for different linux distros)
